# baidudl
This is a multi-thread download tool for linux, it main purpose is used to download from pan.baidu.com. (for Chinese: 这是一个Linux下的多线程下载工具，其初衷是为了用于baidu网盘的多线程下载。初期没有实现对批量下载的地址解析，可能会在以后版本添加更成熟的批量下载方式，但现在您仍需要手动添加地址到一个文件中用于批量下载。)

# Usage

	or your can use batch download, by specify a 'list file'. which is consists by download URLs, and line by line
	bdpandl -n 10 -l listfile
	

# Notice
	The download address is copy from your browser, when you click the
	download button in the page of pan.baidu.com/..., then it pop a new
	link or windows to download. this link just we need.
	
	And I suggested using two single quotes to surround the address, like
	above examples we demostrated.
